**Name:**  

## Instructions

1. Write the list of ideas you've generated (at least 3)

2. For each idea:

- Describe the idea or the problem you want to solve (.e.g. I want to know how much money and polar bears I would save with a vegan diet; It's hard for me to find sheet music for my favorite video game soundtracks;  I want to make a robotic selfie stick that always gets the best angle )

- Describe possible modalities a solution to your idea could take (web, mobile app, wearable, physical). There can be more than one.

3. Briefly summarize what your preferred idea is, and why you want to use this as your project. Describe any goals, concerns or challenges you have. We will use this as a starting point for our individual meetings with you next week.

## Submission

Save the document as _"D0 - Ideas.md"_ and submit to your Deliverables folder in (Github)[www.github.com].

1. Walmart Online Shopper Automated System

 - I would like to automate the established online shopper experience. Utilize the barcode scanning technology in tandem with a conveyor belt with multiple flippers to push totes in their designated area.
 
 - Once filled with the order required items, the shopper places their tote on a conveyor belt to then be processed. This would make it easier on the online shoppers and improve online pick up readiness.

 - This would best be built with a tiny version to simulate the system working on a larger scale. Involving any resources that are available to me, Lego Mindstorm.

 - 3 because I am interested in it, but getting supplies are the problem.

2. Google Home Mini: Game Edition 

 - Use Google Home API to create a voice-controlled game.

 - Intended user would anyone interested to play the game.
 
 - Utilizing the Google Home Mini, I got from a Spotify promotion deal in tandem with Google Home API.

 - 4 because I like the idea, but the software/API is unknown territory.

3. Self-Skating Robot

 - Put a robot on a skateboard to ride. Ither control it manually or by prebuilt in sensors to allow it to be self-driving.

 - For my own amusement and anyone interested in playing with it by controlling it. 

 - using one of my own skateboards and Lego Mindstorm.

 - 2 because I really like the idea of trying this out, but supplies are limited.

## Preferred Idea

I would like to go with the Self Skating Robot. I love to skate, and I have used Lego Mindstorm before in Intro into Robotics. I would believe it to be challenging to me and Adding self-driving mode as an increased difficulty if I believe I can achieve this. The main problem to achieve this is because I don't personally have a Lego Mindstorm. I am a distance learner in Berea. I am not sure I am allowed to use the resources of campus. I could in some capacity I would definitely think this is achievable. This problem goes along with the Walmart Idea.
