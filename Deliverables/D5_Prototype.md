# Prototype Robotic Skateboard

  - Below is a video that shows off the system I have built so far. The linear actuator on top isn't the fastest, even with the help of the gear ratio system to speed it up. It still does the job that is needed which is to show it can turn and move forward by an app.

## Photos of the Prototype Robotic Skateboard

  - This photo shows off the gear system used to make the linear actuator move. The gears on top help move it faster becasue of gear ratio. The motor is below the Linear Actuator becuase it would have been hanging way off the skatboard if i didn't move it.

  - This shows off the other side of the whole system with no gear system of the linear actuator.

  - This shows off the weight on the linear actuator. There are two lego pieces sticking up to help support the weight and more contact points for the duct tape to stick to, to hold up the weight as well.
