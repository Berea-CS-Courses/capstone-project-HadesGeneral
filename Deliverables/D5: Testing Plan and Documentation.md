# Testing

  ## Unit Testing
  
  Here I will be braking down the Robotic Skateboard down into different components. Testing each to find their individual limits, ideal usability, and any problems/bugs that arise through this.
    
   ### Components
   
   #### Linear Acruator
   Purpose: To turn the device by utilizing weight to lean the skateboard one side to the other. 
   
   Findings -
   
   - Here I show off the actuator moving with 2.5 lbs. This is what I have been using with the system so far. This is becasue I think this is the ideal weight that isn't to heavy to break the actuator, but heavy enough to make the skateboard turn. 


   - Here I show off the actuator moving with 5 lbs. 
   
   Found Bugs/mechanical defects: The worm gears that the platform is 
      
   #### NXT App
   Purpose: To control the different motors and sensors of the overall system. 
   
   Found Bugs/mechanical defects: When pressing a button or sending an input from the app to the NXT at the same time the Button Sensor is being activated, it will break the button sensor code. The button sesnor code will cease to work from there on, but the NXT app will work still.
            
   #### Wheels
   Purpose: To move the system forward. 
   
   Found Bugs/mechanical defects:
            
   #### Button Sensor
   Purpose: To stop all motors and back the system up, moving it away from what it had bumped into. 
   
   Found Bugs/mechanical defects: When pressing a button or sending an input from the app to the NXT at the same time the Button Sensor is being activated, it will break the button sensor code. The button sesnor code will cease to work from there on, but the NXT app will work still.

  ## Cognitive Walkthrough 
  
  Here I will be having testers read through instructions and rules of the test where I will have them follow while operating the Robotic Skateboard. Recording what they say, do, and their suggestions while completeing the test. 
    
   ### Instructions
   
   I (Brian) will give the Tester my phone to allow them to control the Robotic Skateboard through the NXT app that i ahve used thus far in the project. I will give them a small demintration on how the controls work on the app. Run through the rules with them, and the goal I wish for them to complete using the app and the Robotic Skateboard. The goal for this test will have the Testers control the Skateboard and manuver it from one end of obstical course to the other. This obstical course will be comprised of a cones spaced roughly euqual distances apart from eachother. The Tester will have to swerve/move in and out of the cones while trying to get from one end of the cones to the other without touching them.
   
   ### Rules
    
   - Weight movement limiter??

# Documentation

Here will be where changes directly done to the build of the Robitc Skateboard system I have created so far shown off in Deliverable 4.5.
