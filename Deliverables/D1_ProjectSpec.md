# Overview
I would like to build a lego robot that will be attached to a skateboard. The user will be able to control said robot remotely, which would entail making it move forward, reverse, and stear the skateboard. 
If time permits I would like it to drive itself as best as I can make it. I want to prove that with the right equipment and time this can become a system that a user can ride and it moves to a user set location.

# Concept
What is in scope of this class is making a lego robot that can be attached to a skateboard and make it move forward and reverse by a user. The next step would make it be able to turn left and right. 
What is out of scope is the ability to make it self drive itself and have it have enough power to support a rider. It would like this to be a concept idea of a self driving skateboard that a user rides. 
Setting a destination and they imply ride it. Similar to a self driving car. 

# Requirements
#### Functional Requirements
- Move forward when designated button is pressed
