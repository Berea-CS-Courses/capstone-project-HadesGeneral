## Proof of Concept

 - The video below is showing off the robot being operated by the app with no weight. This is to show that the robot will go straight when asked. The reason it curves slightly is because the way the weights are attached to the rest of the robot is very flexible so that when it leans to one side that part won't break. becasue of this it also isn't rigid enough to not move in the littles ways. So an uneven floor, which I have, and the wheels not being completely set straight can make it curve slgihtly. This can be fixed by making that part of the robot more rigid, but allowing it to be flexable enough to not break when turning.

-  This video below is to demenstrate if the weight was shifted to the left side of skatebord. Thus making the skateboard moving more to the left drasticly.

-  This video below is to demenstrate if the weight was shifted to the right side of skatebord. Thus making the skateboard moving more to the right drasticly.

## Concept Documentation

1.What external software or tools are needed to run your proof-of-concept? (e.g, general dependencies, build systems, or other frameworks.)

  - This is the NXT Remote Control App. It can be found on the Google play store [HERE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jfedor.nxtremotecontrol&hl=en_US&gl=US).

  - This is the app when it asks what NXt you would like to connect to. To open the app it asks to turn on your Bluetooth. once done it then gives this prompt. If in range of a NXT it will find it and you can tap on the one you want. NXTs can be named similar to how computers, phones, and other devices can named. Which will be used when trying to connect via Bluetooth or other connection type.

2.What steps would need to be taken to run your proof-of-concept? (e.g, run the following command(s) or program(s): ____)

  - You need to download NXT Remote Control App from Google Play store.
  - Make sure the NXt you are using has two ports to connect two motors, but best it has three ports.
  - Get two NXT compatible motors, two connecting cords, and all the nessisary Lego parts needed to build what i have so far.
  - Build robot how it is displayed. 
  - Connect NXT app and Robot.
  - Slide on the corrisponding bars in the app to make move forward.

3.What is the current functionality of the proof of concept as you have submitted it? (e.g, this prototype displays a ____ that allows a user to ____)

4.Are there any components of the code or systems you have submitted that you did not create? If so, document them here alongside their source or reference.
	(e.g, code blocks you might have found on StackOverflow. Code dependencies do not need to be listed here, such as Qt3.)

## Updates

- D1 - Updated Concept, Requirments, Software, and overall cleaned up the document
- D2 - Updated Small Components, Prioritization, and overall cleaned up the document
- D3 - Added an Entity Relationship Diagram, updated Reflection, and overall cleaned up the document

## Reflection

- How confident do you feel about your project now that you have created a working proof-of-concept?

- Have you faced any significant challenges in the creation of your project so far? If so, what are they?

- What do you need from instructors and teaching assistants to better help you implement, understand, or otherwise think about your project?
