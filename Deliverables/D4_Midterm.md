## Proof of Concept

 - The video below is showing off the robot being operated by the app with no weight. This is to show that the robot will go straight when asked. The reason it curves slightly is because the way the weights are attached to the rest of the robot is very flexible so that when it leans to one side that part won't break. because of this it also isn't rigid enough to not move in the littles ways. So, an uneven floor, which I have, and the wheels not being completely set straight can make it curve slightly. This can be fixed by making that part of the robot more rigid but allowing it to be flexible enough to not break when turning.

-  This video below is to demonstrate if the weight was shifted to the left side of skateboard. Thus, making the skateboard moving more to the left drastically.

-  This video below is to demonstrate if the weight was shifted to the right side of skateboard. Thus, making the skateboard moving more to the right drastically.

## Concept Documentation

1.What external software or tools are needed to run your proof-of-concept? (e.g, general dependencies, build systems, or other frameworks.)

  - This is the NXT Remote Control App. It can be found on the Google play store [HERE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jfedor.nxtremotecontrol&hl=en_US&gl=US).

  - This is the app when it asks what NXT you would like to connect to. To open the app, it asks to turn on your Bluetooth. once done it then gives this prompt. If in range of an NXT it will find it and you can tap on the one you want. NXTs can be named similar to how computers, phones, and other devices can named. Which will be used when trying to connect via Bluetooth or other connection type.

2.What steps would need to be taken to run your proof-of-concept? (e.g, run the following command(s) or program(s): ____)

	 1. You need to download NXT Remote Control App from Google Play store.
	 2. Make sure the NXT you are using has two ports to connect two motors, but best it has three ports.
	 3. Get two NXT compatible motors, two connecting cords, and all the necessary Lego parts needed to build what I have so far.
	 4. Build robot how it is displayed. 
	 5. Connect NXT app and Robot.
	 6. Slide on the corresponding bars in the app to make move forward.

3.What is the current functionality of the proof of concept as you have submitted it? (e.g, this prototype displays a ____ that allows a user to ____)

 - I currently can be controlled through the NXT app via Bluetooth. It can move forward and move to the right and left when the weight is on the respected side of the platform above the robot. It can only turn via this method. 

4.Are there any components of the code or systems you have submitted that you did not create? If so, document them here alongside their source or reference. (e.g, code blocks you might have found on StackOverflow. Code dependencies do not need to be listed here, such as Qt3.)

## Reflection

- How confident do you feel about your project now that you have created a working proof-of-concept?

	- I feel pretty confident in making it more sturdy and making the turning being controlled by the app instead of by manually setting the weight on it.

- Have you faced any significant challenges in the creation of your project so far? If so, what are they?

	- The main challenge was acquiring the parts needed to build the robot. This was due to my project being more physical and the parts either needed to be ordered or supplied by the Computer Science department. 
	- The other challenge I had was building the robot overall. The Legos I am using are Lego technic, which are a type of Lego that are not the same as regular building Legos. So, familiarizing with how they work together was needed to make all this work.

- What do you need from instructors and teaching assistants to better help you implement, understand, or otherwise think about your project?
	- At this time, I am not sure of anything specific I need help with.
