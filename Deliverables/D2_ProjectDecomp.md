# Major Components
- Skateboard
- NXT Mind
- Lego Infrastructure
- Lean Apparatus

# Component Details
- Skateboard
  - This will be what everything else will be attached to.
  - It will need flat wheels and very smooth bearings.
  - This is critical for the overall project to happen.
- NXT Mind
  - This will be the "Brains" of the whole machine.
  - It will be what tells all the motors or sensors what to do and how to do it. It is also the power output.
  - It will need the software to code, the different motors, and the cords to connect the motors.
  - This is crucial for the overall project to happen.
- Lego Infrastructure 
  - This will be the skeleton of the project. 
  - This will be attached to the board and the NXT, which also makes sure the NXT is attached to the board. 
  - This will have the motors, wheels, gears, and all other lego necessities needed to attach it to the board. 
  - This is critical for the overall project to happen.
- Lean Apparatus
  - This is how the skateboard will be able to steer.
  - It will be attached to the lego infrastructure.
  - It needs a certain amount of weight to make the board lean, legos to build it, and a motor to maneuver it into a position I need.
  - This is important but not necessary to make it all work.
