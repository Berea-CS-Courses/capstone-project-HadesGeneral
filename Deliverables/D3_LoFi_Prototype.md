# Data Flow Diagram

- This is the Data Flow Diagram of how the app and robot would work together. I chose this type since it was the closest one that could represent the flow of things when it came to interacting with the Robot Skateboard.

# Entity Relationship Diagram

- This is the Entity Relationship Diagram to show off how the different parts interact with each other. The colored arrows designate the flow of one action the robot.

# Cardboard Prototype

- This is the Cardboard Prototype of the Robot Skateboard. The string is to represent the cords to the motors and NXT. The arrows are to represent how the weight, the black colored part on top, would move. On a X axis, left and right. The box under the weight is the NXT and the padding around it. The Board weights 3.5 lb and at the widest point is roughly 7 inches across.

# Reflection

- How was the process of creating your prototype?
  - A bit tedious since I had to go to different stores for the right parts for cheap. But it was fun making the cardboard prototype. Allowed me to create what I had in mind better then drawing it.
- How did this process guide, clarify, or inform your design process?
  - It allowed me to visualize it better and get a sense of how the rest of the build might go. Get a better understanding of where things might go as well.
- What lingering questions do you have regarding modeling or prototyping?
  - None at this moment.
- How prepared do you feel to start tackling the implementation of the system you have modeled and prototyped? 
  - I feel confident in doing it as soon as I get the needed parts. I have what is needed to attach the NXT brain to the board and make it move forward through the app. Making it turn will have to be done with a platform for the weight until I have the necessary parts later.
