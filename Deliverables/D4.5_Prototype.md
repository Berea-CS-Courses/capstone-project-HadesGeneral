# Testing

## Longbaord Test

  - In this video I am showing off that the system I have currently created has the power to move a board that is heavier than the prehvious one. This baord weights roughly 8.8 lb. This is a little over two and half times the weight of the 3.5 lb baord. This is promising and lets me know the system and move with more weight with minor difficulty.

## Gear System

  - Here I am showing off  the gear setup that could help move the weight faster. The wheel is on the middle axle because this allows o nthe lthe first two gears (large gear on the left, and small gear right in front of it) to manipulate it. The other two (the right larger gear and small one in front of it) don't do anything currently. The piece of tape is there to show the speed of the wheel while turning it.

  - Here is the sname gear system but the wheel is on the back axle so that all the gears are manipulating it. This is to show that becaus of this gear system, with less roation of the initial axle, the wheel turns faster than in the prehvious video above. This will allow me to see if a two or a four gear system is needed to move the weight to the speed I need.

## Updated Wheel/Axel Support

  - Here I am showing off the new support for the wheels and axles. This fixes the issue of the wheels being too flexable and interfering with how straight it can go. This also makes the connection to the rest of the stystem stronger, allowing the wheels have less of a problem pulling everything.

## Prototype Linear Actuator

  - Here I am showing off the prototype linear actor with side walls. The walls are there to help support the weight needed for the system. This is needed since  the length of the axle makes it more easier to bend than the shorter ones. Below is pictures of the setup.

  - This video shows off the system working without the weight

  - This video shows of the system with the weight

# Prototype Robotic Skateboard

  - Below is a video that shows off the system I have built so far. The linear actuator on top isn't the fastest, even with the help of the gear ratio system to speed it up. It still does the job that is needed which is to show it can turn and move forward by an app. The weight on the Linear Actuator is 2.5 lbs and the skateboard weighs 3.8 lbs. In total, the entire system weights 9.4 lbs roughly. Taking way the weight (2.5 lbs) and the skateboard (3.8 lbs), the rest is about 3.1 lbs.

## Photos of the Prototype Robotic Skateboard

  - This photo shows off the gear system used to make the linear actuator move. The gears on top help move it faster becasue of gear ratio. The motor is below the Linear Actuator becuase it would have been hanging way off the skatboard if i didn't move it.

  - This shows off the other side of the whole system with no gear system of the linear actuator.

  - This shows off the weight on the linear actuator. There are two lego pieces sticking up to help support the weight and more contact points for the duct tape to stick to, to hold up the weight as well.

## Weight platform

 - Below are the changes I made to the platform on the Linear Actuator that holds the 2.5 lb weight. I added the yellow bars on top so it doesn't bounce out of it.

## Types of Ports

  - Here is the Motor ports. These are intended to be used only with motor type parts in the Lego Mindstorm kit. If you were to code a program using the NXT Programming Application you would specifcy which port (A, B, C) would do what (i.e. Rotate a certain way, stop rotations, rotate a certain amount of time or degrees) with the motor.

  - Here is the Sensor ports. These are intented to be used with the many sensor type parts in the Lego Mindstorm kit. These can range from a button, light sensor, sound sensor, and many more. Using the NXT Programming Application, you can code what the specifcid sensor in the specified port (1, 2, 3, 4) showing in the photo below underlined.

## Backup Button

  - This section will be over the button sensor dipicted below at the front of the skateboard. This was a stretch goal, and it's intention was to back up the Robotic Skateboard when it runs into something infront of it.  In the photos below, I show off the button sensor and how it is attachted to the skateboard. Either on press, hold, or on release the button can do actions specified within the currently running program on the NXT.

![Button Sensor on Skateboard](/Images/Button_Sensor_on_Skateboard.jpg)

  - Here is a video showing off the button on the Robotic Skateboard. It shows off me using the NXT app to move the skateboard forward into a door. When it hits the door, it backs up. I do this a couple times to demenstrat the fucntion. The last time you see it run intothge door, I actually manually back it up with the app. This is because there is a bug with using the app while a program on the NXT brain is running. When this happens it breaks the program and simply doesn't do anyhting anymore when the button is pressed.  So resetting the program in needed for it to work again.

### Backing Up Function

  - Below is the block code used for the Backup Program. This programs intention is when it bumps into soemthing infront of it it will stop all motors, and then to back up the skateboard. 

![Backing up Button Code](/Images/NXT_Backingup_Button_code.JPG)

  - Here is an annotated version of the code. 1 is a loop block, all within the middle of it will contine to run either forever, or for a specified amount of times/loops. 2 is the button block, it tells the program when the button in the specified sensor port is being pressed, released, or is being held down. All within this block loop will run on the designated button action. 3 and 4 are the motor blocks. They tell the motors in the specified ports what they do. This program will run forever using the loop block and constantly looks for when the button in the 1st sensor port is being pressed using the button sensor block. When it is pressed, it stops all the motors I need, in ports B and C, then makes those run the oppisite way. Making the Robitic Skateboard back up when it runs into something in front of it.
