1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain) 
  - I was able to conncect the Linear Actuator to the currently built system. (D4.5 shows this.)
  - I was able to get it to work together with only a few hickups, since they were built sepertly, so new parts needed to be intergrated or moved around. (D4.5 shows this.)
  - I was able to test and show off the system working in it's entirety. (D4.5 shows this.)
2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
  - I had trouble figuring out where to move the Linear Actuator's motor since I couldn't have it hang off. And so i moved it to under the Linear Actuator, and right beside the Lego Brain. I achived this by transfering the rotational movement of the motor with a axle and gear setup. (D4.5 shows this.)
3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
  - make a better platform for the weight on the Linear Actuator.
    - Specific: The platform on the linear actutor currently can not support the weight correctly. It needs duck tape as extra support, and even then it isn't as strcutually sound. So making it where the weight can lay down without falling off when using the system will be the goal.
    - Measurable: If the weight doesn't fall off or it doesn't move as easily loying down, then I have achived the goal.
    - Achievable: This is kind achievable. The hard part is going to be making sure I don't change the setup to much so that it still works as intended. 
  - Test systemwith flatter ground.
    - Specific: I prehviously tested the prototype of the system on a road that was not completly flatt. The sides rose towards the middle, similar to a small hill. This may had an effect on the movement of the system since it would need more power to go up the inclines when turning. 
    - Measurable: Make a setup where I can show the time different of how long it takes to go from the middle, one side, and then to the other on the road and then a flatter terrain. 
    - Achievable: This is achivable, the only constrain is time. With work and other school obligations it is hard to find time to do something like this.
  - Added a bump sensor.
    - Specific: As a stretch goal i would liek to add a bump sensor. This is a button like part the can intergrate into the Lego Mindsotrm. This will allow me to make a program that when the button is pressed it will shut off all functions then make the motors back up the skateboard. As a emergency backup system of sorts. 
    - Measurable: If the button is pressed and it stops functions for  amoment, then makes the skateboard back up then this shows I have done it. 
    - Achievable: This is sort of, becuase the coding is semi-unformilar so coding this will be hard. I also don't want to break the sytem I have built so far, so I am wary for it all so far.
4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
  - Current system
  - Tape
  - Stopwatch
  - Button sensor
