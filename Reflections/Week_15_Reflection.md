1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain) 
  - I was able to create and add in a lot of details for the Unit Testing (shown in D5)
  - Changed Cognative Walkthrough to vertical End-to-End testing. Did the outline and did one type of testing. (shown in D5)
2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
  - Finding a second device to record things since the app is on my phone. One of the professors gave me a camera and a tablet to allow me to do this now. The main difficulty now is finding time to do the rest of what is needed.
3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
  - film and do the rest of the End-to-End Testng (continuous, 2+ hours)
    - Specific: I need to test the entire system with the goal of it to be focused on the turnability of the entire system.
    - Measurable: i will be using a measuring tape and cones to help figure out how much it can turn. 
    - Achievable: Sort of, the main conflict is finding time and the space. The space I have been using is the Berea park and it's parking lot. It isn't alwasy free to use.
  - Test wheels with gravel. (30 minutes)
    - Specific: I got to record the system trying to run over gravel. To see if it is possible, if so, how easily does it go over it. 
    - Measurable: Yes, if it struggles at all then it is not an ideal surface for the system to run on. 
    - Achievable: This is achievable, just need to find a place and record.
  - Create and finish Presention slides(5+ hours)
    - Specific: I need to create and finish the presentation on google slides for the final of the class. 
    - Measurable: Once I have everything needed in the Rubric for the class, then i know i have completed it, or near finish.
    - Achievable: This is since I have already started on creating it and it is needed to finish the course.
