1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain) 
  - Made the conncetion point of the wheel/axle and the rest of the ssystem stronger and less flexible. (shown off in D4)
  - I found conveyor belt examples if I need to make it in the future. (shown in the Research folder, Youtube link file)
  - I got the axle i need to complete a prototype linear actuator. (Shown off in D4)
2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
  - I had the difficulty with the new linear actutor being to flexible. This was becasue the axle is so long and made out of plastic it is more flexible than the shorter axles. I fixed this by extending the platform on the actuator and added walls for that platform to rest on while there is weight baring down on it. 
3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
  - Try to put the prototype linear actuator on the current system
    - Specific: try to attach the linear actuator to the current system in any way I can.
    - Measurable: If it is attached and doens't fall off with the weight when moving it by hand, then I know I have done it.
    - Achievable: This is kind achievable. The hard part is going to be making sure the motor is secure as well since that might be off the board, or I might need to agjust the linear actuator a little to accomidate it.
  - Test the system
    - Specific: If i get the system together then I will test it like I did before.
    - Measurable: Use the same set up of the measuring tape on the floor and putting the weight on it. turing it using the app this time.
    - Achievable: It is is I get the system built.
4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
  - Current system
  - Prototype linear actuator
