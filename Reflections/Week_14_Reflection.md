1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain) 
  - I made the platform for the Linear Actuator better and a way for it to not fall out from movement. (D4.5 shows this.)
  - Added a bump sensor and programmed it so that when it is pressed it stops all motors and backs up the Robtic Skateboard. (D4.5 shows this.)
2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
  - I was not able to complete the test the system on flatter ground goal in Weekly Reflection 13. This was because of weather, school, and work obligations. There wasn't time to complete this test. I also have no idea how to prove the difference between the two surfaces.
3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
  - Create the rules and intructions for the Cognitive Walkthrough Testng (continuous, 2+ hours)
    - Specific: I need to outline the instructions, rules, and what all the Tester will be doing wihtin a Cognitive Walkthrough test I will create for my Robtic Skateboard.
    - Measurable: Once it is outlined enough to the satisfaction of the professors I will begin testing. 
    - Achievable: Very much since it is mainly writing up all the information and thinking of what the tester needs to do. The hard part will be how thorough I am with explaining what is needed.
  - Test system with flatter ground. ( 2 hours)
    - Specific: I previously tested the prototype of the system on a road that was not completely flat. The sides rose towards the middle, similar to a small hill. This may have an effect on the movement of the system since it would need more power to go up the inclines when turning. 
    - Measurable: Make a setup where I can show the time different of how long it takes to go from the middle, one side, and then to the other on the road and then a flatter terrain. 
    - Achievable: This is achievable, the only constrain is time. With work and other school obligations it is hard to find time to do something like this.
  - Create the outline and fill out what all I need to do for a Unit Testing (3+ hours)
    - Specific: I have chose to do Unit Testing as my second testing for my project. This involves me testing each componet of the Robtic Skateboard,a dn documenting these findings in a document. 
    - Measurable: Each componet has it's limits and ideal states. Finding these are the goal of the Unit testing and this is how it can be measured. Once I have these two parts documented then I can move to more type sof tests for each componet. 
    - Achievable: This is since I have been doing this already through the class, but wasn't testing as hard, only small buts. I just need to either collect what I have already to one document, or test others I havn't done already.
